I'm using Duck DB to create a database table thus enabling me to pull some summary metrics to be used in the presentation.     


How to run:
1. Install DuckDB
2. Save the Sample data as a csv file
3. Upload to Duck DB as a table called:  ca_candidate_project_data
4. Ensure column data types so that numerical values are stored as integer or double; month is stored as date.   I had to make sure the csv file saved numbers without commas.   I have stored off column data types in Describe_Output.csv
6. Run the SQL Files 



Note:   I will remove access to this repository immediately after the interview process completes.
